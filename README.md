The Blur Component is a configurable image preprocessing module designed to apply various types of blurring effects to images. 
## Build with
- OpenCV
- Wsl
- Redis


## Features

- ✅ Supports multiple blur types:
    - Gaussian Blur
    - Average Blur
    - Median Blur
    - Bilateral Filter
- 🎛️ Configurable **kernel size** for tuning the blur intensity
- 📦 Easily integrates with existing Novavision-ai packages 


## Usage

There are 2 executors in Blur. 

- ImageFocused: Blurs the given image completely 
- DetectionFocused: Blurs the detections on the given image 

1   . ImageFocused: It takes 1 input as InputImage and gives 1 output as OutputImage. Use of the ImageFocused can be seen at the image below.

2   . DetectionFocused: It takes 2 input as InputImage and InputDetections and gives 1 output as OutputImage. Use of the DetectionFocused can be seen at the image below.

## Supported Configurations

| Parameter     | Type | Description                                           | Default      |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `BlurType`   | str  | Type of blur: `"Gaussian"`, `"Average"`, `"Median"`, `"Bilateral"` | `"Gaussian"` |
| `KernelSize` | int  | Size of the kernel (must be odd) (<52)                 | `25`          |
